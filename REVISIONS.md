Are there any sections that you would have done differently with
hindsight? Anything that you'd like to refactor given more time?

If I were to approach the section where I was checking neighbors in the matrix I would have tried to find a simpler/cleaner solution. Perhaps utilizing higher order functions. I also would have refactored my return value for the neighbors method thus making my conditionals more clean. 

If given more time I would try to minimize the nesting of my conditional statements. Maybe by using a switch statement, ternary operators, or attempting other conditions. I would have also spent more time writing tests and would have taken a more tdd approach to pass the specs prior to implementing any functionality.
